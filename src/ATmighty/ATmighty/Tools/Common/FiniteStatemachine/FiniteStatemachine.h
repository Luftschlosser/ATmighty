/*!
 * This class implements a finite Statemachine. The internal state is represented as an integer, but you may use a
 * well-defined enum (of type uint8_t) for a more comfortable use. The state can be changed by calling "changeState()".
 * When changing the state from inside one of the action-handlers (enter-, exit- or change-Actions), the change will not be
 * executed immediately but instead be buffered and executed after the current change is finished. When the state is changed
 * multiple times while a change is executed, only the last change will be executed.
 * Action-Handlers can only be set BEFORE "start()" was called. This will start the statemachine in a well-defined state and
 * will block any future changes of the handler-setup. This was implemented because changing the handlers themself while
 * running the statemachine could potentially lead to undefined behavior when using asynchronous design.
