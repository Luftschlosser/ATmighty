 * This class represents a stop-watch which can be used to measure cycle-precise delays between the call to start() and the call to stop().
 * The template-parameter "Timer" defines the type of timer to be used for measurement. This must be an abstract Timer, as virtual ones will
 * not be fast enough for cycle-precise measurements. It is recommended to provide a specific timer-type if it is known at compiletime, as this
 * will reduce the time needed to call the timer-methods significantly because no vtable-entries will need to be dereferenced.
 * Possible values are:
 * AbstractTimer16bit [default], AbtractTimer8bit, and all specific AbstractTimerN's of this ÂµC.
 * For the Stopwatch to be able to measure consistently precise values, it is recommended to not use any interrupts which might occur during
 * measurement. But Interrupts need to stay enabled, as the Stopwatch itself does need timer-interrupts to work correctly.
